# FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification
A repository to host the projects I completed to achieve FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification

Each project has been hosted on GitHub Pages as a simple interactive and responsive webpage made up of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

GitHub Pages Link (for my reference): https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification


## The following projects/coding challenges were completed to gain this certification:

1. [Survey Form](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/survey-form/survey-form.html)
2. [Tribute Page](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/tribute-page/tribute-page.html)
3. [Technical Documentation Page](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/technical-documentation-page/technical-documentation-page.html)
4. Product Landing Page (Coming Soon)
5. Personal Portfolio Page (Coming Soon)

## Project 1: [Survey Form](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/survey-form/survey-form.html)
*Note: The form isn't submitted to anywhere so nothing happens when you click submit*

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:

- You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title
- You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description
- You should have a form element with an id of survey-form
- Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text
- Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email
- If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
- Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number
- The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).
- If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
- For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
- For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
- Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
- Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
- Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
- Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments
- Inside the form element, you are presented with a button with id of submit to submit all the inputs

## Project 2: [Tribute Page](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/tribute-page/tribute-page.html)
*Note: The image is something I made in paint so I don't have to deal with potential copywright issues*

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:

- Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
- You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
- You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
- Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
- Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
- You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
- You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
- Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
- Your img element should be centered within its parent element

## Project 3: [Technical Documentation Page](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/technical-documentation-page/technical-documentation-page.html)
*Note: The media query user story is achieved with bootstrap responsive sizing*

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:

- You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
- Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
- The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
- Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
- The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
- The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
- The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
- You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
- The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
- Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
- The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
- Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
- When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
- On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
- Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
